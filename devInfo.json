            "description": "I have a background in game development where I worked at a coding academy called Code Ninjas. I taught young students from the ages of 5 to 15 the basics of coding and game development. I also have experience in web development where I worked with a team of other university students in the 'Calgary Solar Car Club' where I developed their telemetry site and inventory portal."

When developing the frontend, I prefer to use TailwindCSS but I also have experience in Bulma and Bootstrap. I'm always looking to import a new Node library to spice up my website. As for back-end development, I mainly use Python, AWS, mySQL, and sometimes Firebase. On top of my web development skills, I also have experience in a multitude of different languages such as C, C++, Java, and Assembly. While I typically prefer web development, I take great interest in embedded hardware and software programming. I also have skills in version control, most notably git, and when working with others, I frequently use Figma and Jira. Currently, I am learning about the MERN stack and investigating in machine learning."

            "description": "I bring more than a tech stack to the table. When it comes to working with others I like to convey my ideas through drawings, diagrams, and neatly presented slide decks. I like to resolve conflict immediately and cannot leave grudges in the back of my mind. I love it when I feel like I am contributing to something greater than myself. Problem solving comes naturally to me, especially when given the right tools and information. I prefer to be a listener rather than a talker, I'm an introvert and like to carefully sort out my thoughts before thinking. When it comes to building relationships with others, I am not afraid to ask the hard questions and invite others to challenge me."

My coding journey began when I was first introduced to Python in my freshman year of university. I immediately showed interest in being able to write robust and beautiful code. In the future, I hope I can find an exciting career in web-development where I can tackle challenging problems and come up with creative solutions."

I am hoping that I can use my skills in software engineering to make technology more accessible and available to those in need."

It is a strategy type game similar to Chess where you assemble your units to defeat your opponents. I am happy to have reached a competitive level in that game, reaching Masters (top 1% playerbase) in Set 3. When I am feeling more relaxed, I like to play Pokemon Go on the university campus and catch Pokemon with my friends."
